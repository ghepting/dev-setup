# Gary's Automated Dev Setup

### Install Homebrew and packages

Run setup script:

```bash
bin/setup
```

Note: If Homebrew is not already installed, it will prompt you for sudo access. This comes from the [Homebrew setup script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh). See [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) for more information.
